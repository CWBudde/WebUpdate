Update Helper Wizard
====================

In order to perform a web update from a running application, the application must be closed first while a helper tool is started to perform the download and replacement of files.
Since this helper tool must exists along with the main executable file, it can also serve as a stand-alone wizard to update the application while not running.

The source code, which can be found in this directory is meant to produce both: An update helper and a stand-alone update wizard.
