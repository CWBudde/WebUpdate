WebUpdate
=========

WebUpdate is a bunch of code that can be included into any application to add some simple JSON based WebUpdate. The contained authoring tool allows to create snapshots with a single click. These snapshots can be copied to a dedicated location or uploaded to an FTP server. This can also be done automatically when taking a snapshot.

The tool was created after thinking about how a modern, lightweight web update tool could work without the need of an extra server (only file serving is required). It is not yet used and thus mostly untested beyond the used in the tool itself.
